# Knowledgebase

This is my personal collection of documents for interesting stuff that I have learnt and implemented. 
It includes snippets, parts of code, and may be an entire clipping from different interesting sources consolidated and curated together for my easy reference.
Some of the material used / mentioned here belong to their respective copy right holders.

Now that you have read all thorough this, the idea is to create my own knowledge base, using a [Raneto][] Server, running in a docker container. I work on this knowledge base in my part time, hence expect lot many `Work in progress` pages and some incomplete documents.

You have been warned!
